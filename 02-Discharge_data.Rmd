# Discharge Data Example

*This was the first assignment for the course, where students were asked to create a Github account and then answer a couple basic questions about river discharge using Rmarkdown.* 

*Assignment composed by Matt Ross.*

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(dataRetrieval)
library(dygraphs)
library(xts)
library(revealjs)
```


## Example & Methods

The Poudre River at Lincoln Bridge is:

  - Downstream of only a little bit of urban stormwater

  - Near Odell Brewing CO
  
  - Near an open space area and the Poudre River Trail
  
  - **Downstream of many agricultral diversions**

### Data Acquisition and Plotting tests

#### Data Download


```{r downloader}

q <- readNWISdv(siteNumbers = '06752260',
                parameterCd = '00060',
                startDate = '2017-01-01',
                endDate = '2022-01-01') %>%
  rename(q = 'X_00060_00003')


```



#### Static Data Plotter


```{r Static, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5}

ggplot(q, aes(x = Date, y = q)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  ylab('Q (cfs)') + 
  ggtitle('Discharge in the Poudre River, Fort Collins')

```


#### Interactive Data Plotter


```{r data plotter}

q_xts <- xts(q$q, order.by = q$Date)


dygraph(q_xts) %>%
  dyAxis("y", label = "Discharge (cfs)") 
```



## Assignment 


This assignment will be primarily about demonstrating some expertice in using
RMarkdown, since we will be using Rmds as the primary form of homework and 
assignments. With that in mind, your assignment for this homework is to:


1) Fork the example repository into your personal GitHub

2) Create an RStudio project from your Personal clone of the Repo. 

3) Create a table of contents that is floating, but displays three levels of
headers instead of two (by editing the content at the beginning of the document)

4) Make a version of the `dygraph` with points and lines by using rstudio's
dygraph [guide](https://rstudio.github.io/dygraphs/)

5) Writing a paragraph on the Poudre river with at least three hyperlinks,
**two bolded sections**, and one *italicized phrase*. The content of this paragraph
is not vital, but try to at least make it true and interesting, and, of course,
don't plagiarize. 

6) Knit that document, and then git commit and push to your personal GitHub.

7) Use the GitHub -> Settings -> Pages tab to create a website of your report.

8) Bonus, make the timestamp in the header dynamic. As in it only adds
todays date, not just a static date you enter. 

9) Bonus, create an "index_talk.Rmd" version of your document using the
`revealjs` package. Add link to your original report-style document. 


### DyGraph example 

```{r dygraph}

q_xts <- xts(q$q, order.by = q$Date) #creates a df where you order by date for a dygraph

dygraph(q_xts) %>% #dygraph with labels
  dyAxis("y", label = "Discharge (cfs)") %>% 
  dyOptions(drawPoints = TRUE, pointSize = 3) %>% 
  dySeries("V1", strokeWidth = 2, strokePattern = "dashed")

```

### Poudre Paragraph

My grandmother has always claimed that her grandfather lost the farm when the water he ordered was not delivered. I looked into this after an introductory class on Colorado Water Law (AREC 342!) and was able to determine that my immigrant great-great-grandfather, Paul Smith, was the secretary of Buckeye Lateral Ditch Company from sometime in the mid 1920s to the 1940s. [His name](https://archives.mountainscholar.org/digital/collection/p17393coll186/id/13436/rec/1) is mentioned through correspondence with the Northern Poudre Irrigation Company, who used ditch riders allocating water to the [Buckeye Lateral](https://dwr.state.co.us/Tools/Structures/0301111). Paul had *50 shares* of the water right, which came off a [diversion](https://npicwater.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/repair-of-structure-along-the-buckeye-lateral.jpg) from Boxelder Creek, which is fed by the Park Creek Reservoir, which is fed itself by the **North Fork of the Cache la Poudre River.** Allocation records kept by the Northern Poudre Irrigation Company indicate that perhaps he did not lose the farm (being secretary of the ditch company) but rather that, given his age, he **retired and sold the farm.**
