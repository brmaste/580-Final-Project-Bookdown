With that in mind, your assignment for this homework is to: Fork the example repository into your personal GitHub Create an RStudio project from your Personal clone of the Repo. Create a table of contents that is floating, but displays three levels of headers instead of two (by editing the content at the beginning of the document) Make a version of the dygraph with points and lines by using rstudios dygraph guide Writing a paragraph on the Poudre river with at least three hyperlinks, two bolded sections, and one italicized phrase. The content of this paragraph is not vital, but try to at least make it true and interesting, and, of course, dont plagiarize. Knit that document, and then git commit and push to your personal GitHub. Use the GitHub -&gt; Settings -&gt; Pages tab to create a website of your report. Bonus, make the timestamp in the header dynamic. As in it only adds todays date, not just a static date you enter. Bonus, create an index_talk.Rmd version of your document using the revealjs package. Add link to your original report-style document. 4.1 DyGraph example q_xts &lt;- xts(q$q, order.by = q$Date) dygraph(q_xts) %&gt;% dyAxis(&quot;y&quot;, label = &quot;Discharge (cfs)&quot;) %&gt;% dyOptions(drawPoints = TRUE, pointSize = 3) %&gt;% dySeries(&quot;V1&quot;, strokeWidth = 2, strokePattern = &quot;dashed&quot;) 4.2 Poudre Paragraph My grandmother has always claimed that her grandfather lost the farm when the water he ordered was not delivered. I looked into this after an introductory class on Colorado Water Law (AREC 342!) and was able to determine that my immigrant great-great-grandfather, Paul Smith, was the secretary of Buckeye Lateral Ditch Company from sometime in the mid 1920s to the 1940s. His name is mentioned through correspondence with the Northern Poudre Irrigation Company, who used ditch riders allocating water to the Buckeye Lateral. Paul had 50 shares of the water right, which came off a diversion from Boxelder Creek, which is fed by the Park Creek Reservoir, which is fed itself by the North Fork of the Cache la Poudre River. Allocation records kept by the Northern Poudre Irrigation Company indicate that perhaps he did not lose the farm (being secretary of the ditch company) but rather that, given his age, he retired and sold the farm. 4.3 Presentation Version Link Link to revealjs presentation file "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
